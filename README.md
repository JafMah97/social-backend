## 🚀 Features

This project leverages a powerful and modern tech stack to provide a robust and efficient backend for social applications.

- **Fastify:** A highly performant and low-overhead Node.js framework.
- **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves code quality.
- **Socket.IO:** Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **ESM:** Uses the modern `import/export` syntax for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Expressive CLI:** Utilizes libraries like **Chalk**, **Boxen**, and **Figlet** for a visually appealing and informative command-line interface.
